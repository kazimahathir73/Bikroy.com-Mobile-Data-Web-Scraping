# Bikroy.com Mobile Data Web Scraping

**Project Overview**

This Python project scrapes mobile phone data from https://bikroy.com/.
Due to hardware limitations, the script currently scrapes data from the first 5 pages of the website.

**Dependencies**

* Python (version: specify your Python version)
* Required Python libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup4, requests, pandas, etc.)

**Data Structure**

The scraped data is stored in a CSV file with the following columns:

* mobile_name
* model
* price
* review
* feature
* owner_name
* model
* date_time
* location

**Limitations**

* Due to hardware constraints, the script currently only scrapes the first 5 pages of the website.
* The script might be affected by changes in the website's structure.

**Future Improvements**

* Expand scraping to more pages or implement pagination.
* Improve data cleaning and preprocessing.
* Consider using a database to store the scraped data.
